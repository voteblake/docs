This repository contains the developer documentation and getting started guides for all [Macchina](https://www.macchina.cc/) products.

Contributing

All the documentation is open source and we appreciate your help!  If you have a suggestion or encounter a problem, please open an issue.  If you want to make a change, please submit a pull request.

You can make changes either by editing files on the GitHub website, or by cloning this repository to and editing on your computer.  Instructions for building the book are below.

Building
--------

If you already [have GitBook installed](#dependencies), simply run the following from the repository directory:

> gitbook serve

The above command will build the book and then start a web server so you can view it.  Once the web server is running, it will display the URL you should visit (usually <http://localhost:4000>).

Dependencies
------------

This project is built with [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook-cli).  To try it yourself you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.  Once you have Node.js installed, install `gitbook-cli`:

> npm install -g gitbook-cli
