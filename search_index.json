Building the M2 has always been a goal of ours. Our crowdfunding campaign was the catalyst that transformed us from friends and an idea to a company and a product. We are very thankful to everyone who enabled this transformation. We repay you through our hard work and dedication to this project.\nWe would also like to thank the organizations that have helped build the communities that the M2 relies on: Arduino, DIGI International, Digi-Key, the EFF, Hackaday, and Open Garages. Finally, to the developers who spend their own time building essential tools, answering questions on the forum, and testing, thank you.\nDevice Summary\n\nM2 by Macchina is an open and versatile automotive interface that can take your car to the next level. Use it to customize your ride or as a development platform for your next product. M2 works with almost any vehicle and features an SAM3X ARM Cortex-M3 processor at its core---the same processor as the Arduino Due. An XBee form factor socket allows for many wireless capabilities.\nYou can ead more about M2 general features on our website.\nGoals\nAs we developed the Macchina M2, we set out with the following goals:\n\nHelp foster a new generation of car nerds\nDevelop an innovative product for a wide range of automotive functions\nSupport the DIY and Open Source ecosystem\nProvide companies with a great tool for fast prototyping\nDisplay our ability to develop and mass produce quality hardware\n\nSpecification\nThe M2 is an open source automotive interface that takes the form of an OBD2 \"under-the-Dash\" dongle or hard-wired \"under-the-hood\" device. Each M2 has all the interface circuitry needed to connect to the 5+ standard OBD2 protocols plus other interfaces such as a second CAN bus, LIN bus, and single-wire CAN.  It also includes several options for connections to the outside world including: SD card, USB Device and Host, 20-pin (sort of standard) XBee socket, and a general purpose connector.\n\nWe designed the M2 to be modular and the result was three main related, but independent, components.\nThe M2 Interface Board provides most of the hardware support for automotive connections. The goal was for M2 to be able to interface and communicate with as many cars as possible. We crammed 2 channels of CAN, 2 channels of LIN/K-LINE, a J1850 VPW/PWM and even a single-wire CAN (GMLAN) interface onto the board. Automotive environments require the M2 to be seriously strong, so we built in plenty of protection circuitry. Lastly, we have 6 general purpose driver circuits, which can source and sink up to 1 amp of current at 12 volts!\nThe M2 Processor Board is the standard computing engine for the Macchina M2.  We chose the Arduino Due as the basis of M2's processor board. Shrinking the Due by well over 50% was no small task! We decided to make further improvements by using the High Speed SD card interface and writing the appropriate firmware libraries to allow for faster data logging. We also added several LED options and a couple switches for a more pleasant development experience. Lastly, we tacked on an EEPROM to store variables after power is cut to M2.  The processor BCB can be swapped with a Breakout Board to more easily use the M2 Interface Board with your choice of processor.\nA wireless socket on the M2 Processor Board accommodates a wide variety of wireless options using the popular DIGI XBee form factor socket. Many inexpensive, plug-and-play boards already exist including BLE, WIFI, GSM, 3G, LTE, GPS and others. This can even be used to reprogram the M2 wirelessly.\n"},"m2/disclaimer.html":{"url":"m2/disclaimer.html","title":"Disclaimer","keywords":"","body":"Safety\nYour car might be the best hacking canvas you own, but it is also inherently dangerous.

One of the quickest and easiest ways is to use the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) which is what this documentation will use. Many other development environments work well including Atmel Studio and Simulink®.\nThe first thing you will need to do is set up the Arduino IDE.  After that you might choose to build and run an existing project or write something your own.  There are many libraries available for the M2 and most include examples sketchs that you can run on your M2.\nEnclosures\nIt is ok to do some initial setup before you have an enclosure, but before your M2 spends long periods in the car please consider protecting it. We have a few configurations of enclosures designed and ready for 3D printing. You can download the designs, tweak them as needed, print, share, lather, rinse, repeat.\nFind more about enclosures here.\n"},"m2/getting-started/arduino.html":{"url":"m2/getting-started/arduino.html","title":"Arduino IDE Quick Start","keywords":"","body":"Arduino IDE Quick Start\nBy completing this guide you will configure the Arduino IDE for developing on the Macchina M2 and run your first sketch on the M2.  This will verify both your Arduino IDE setup and your M2 device.\nThe following steps are needed to get started programming on the Macchina M2 with the Arduino IDE:\n\nInstall the Arduino Desktop IDE\nInstall the Macchina M2 Board Configuration\nInstall drivers\nBuild and upload a sketch\n\nArduino Desktop IDE\nFollow the official installation instructions for your operating system then return here to continue with Macchina M2 specific setup.\n\nWindows\nmacOS\nLinux\n\nMacchina M2 Board Configuration\nNow that you have the Arduino IDE Installed, you will add support for the for Macchina M2.\nFirst, you will tell the IDE where to find the Macchina board configuration files.  Go to File > Preferences.  Paste\nhttps://macchina.cc/package_macchina_index.json \ninto the Additional Board Manager URLs: box and press OK.  This tells the Arduino IDE where to look to find the board configuration files for Macchina boards.\nNext, you will open the Boards Manager to download the needed board configurations.  Find the board manager under Tools > Board: \"[...]\" > Boards Manager...\nIn the board manager, install Arduino SAM Boards (32-bit ARM Cortex-M3) by Arduino.  Then install Macchina SAM Boards (Install Arduino SAM Boards first) by Macchina.\nNote: If for any reason you cannot use the Board Manager to install the board configuration files, you have the option to do a manual install but will not benefit from the updates notification provided by the Board Manager when new versions are released.\nDrivers\nYou may need to install a driver to enable your computer to communicate with the Macchina M2 before you can send sketches to it.  The Macchina M2 is based on the Arduino Due and uses the same driver.  Please visit the official Arduino Due documentation for instructions on installing drivers.\nBe careful when plugging the micro-USB cable into your M2.  The M2's design allows you to put it in a case or enclosure.  The connector cable may stick out farther than you expect, because there needs to be clearance space for a case.\nWhen you have finished installing drivers, leave your Macchina M2 plugged into the computer.\nRunning your first sketch\nNow that you have the Arduino IDE setup and your M2 connected, you can run your first sketch on the M2 by performing the followings steps in the Arduino IDE.\nFirst, you will make Macchina M2 the active board.  Tools > Board: \"[...]\" > Macchina M2.\nNext, open the Blink sketch. File > Examples > 01. Basics > Blink.\nFinally, in the opened window, upload the sketch to your M2 board.  Sketch > Upload.\nIt will take a few moments for the sketch to be written as firmware to your Macchina M2.  You can watch the progress at the bottom of the IDE window.  When the upload has completed, you should see a flashing LED on your Macchina M2.\nCongratulations!  You have now configured your computer for development on the M2 and run your first program.  As a next step, you may choose to learn the names of the other LEDs on the Macchina M2 using the pin mapping.  Then you can practice modifying the sketch to make other LEDs blink.\nYou may also wish to explore the other sketches under the Examples menu.  Most libraries include examples which can be accessed by the Examples menu after the library is installed.

Any car built after 1996 has an OBD2 port near the steering wheel, under the dash.\n\nThe OBD2 connector is a 16 pin connector that provides power and a data connection.

This connector takes the form of a 24-pin pluggable connector. Typical usage for this connector would be a more permanent installation where M2 would be hard-wired or spliced into an existing cable harness.\n\nThe image below shows the pin orientation of the 24 pin connector.

This includes:\n\n2x CAN bus\n1x SWCAN (single wire can)\n2x LIN/9141\nJ1805 VPW/PWM\n\nTo find libraries for any M2 interfaces, try the [Macchina Community Showcase] (http://showcase.macchina.cc/libraries.html).\n\nIn addition, every M2 has a 26 pin \"expansion\" connector that provides even more connection options. For example: UART, SPI, I2C, general purpose 12V drivers and 12V analog inputs. See the schematic for actual pinout details.\nRefer to the following diagram for pin 1 location.\n\nCAN\nController Area Network\nCAN bus is a vehicle bus standard used in most cars built after 2006. It is a message-based protocol that allows modules within a car to communicate with one another. While the physical layer is understood and open, the actual meaning of the messages sent over the bus are not. While some messages are legislated to be \"standard\", the majority of CAN messages in your typical car are not well documented.\nThe M2 has 2 CAN channels (in addition to the single-wire CAN channel) that can interface directly to the CAN bus network of your car. The M2 uses the 2 built-in CAN controllers found in the SAM3X and 2 external TJA1051 transceivers.\nHere is the link to the datasheet: http://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/TJA1051.pdf\nCAN bus connections can be found on either the 16-pin OBD2 connector on the under-the-dash M2 or the 24-pin connector used by the under-the-hood M2.\n\n\nSingle-wire CAN\nThe Macchina M2 provides single-wire CAN support using a MCP2515 CAN controller.\nLIN\nLocal Interconnect Network bus is an inexpensive, single wire, serial network protocol used in many modern cars. Typically, LIN would be used to control and monitor lower-priority devices such as seat positions, door locks, radio and illumination.\nThe M2 has 2 LIN channels that can interface directly to the LIN bus network of your car. Your M2 uses 2 external TJA1027 transceivers connected via UART to the processor.\nHere is the link to the datasheet: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/TJA1027.pdf\nNote that the TJA1027 transceiver is used for both LIN and ISO9141 (K-LINE/L-LINE) for a total of 2 channels.\nLIN bus connections can be found on either the 16-pin OBD2 connector on the under-the-dash M2 or the 24-pin connector used by the under-the-hood M2.\nK-line\nISO9141 (K-Line) interface uses the TJA1021. While this part is designed for LIN, it is also K-line compatible.\nHere is the link to the datasheet: https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/TJA1027.pdf\nJ1850\nJ1850 supports multiple/variants modes. To change between the levels required for PWM and VPW variants of J1850, use this signal:\nJ1850_PWM_nVPW\nThis signal is connected to physical pin 123 (PB8) of the SAM3X.\nMake this pin HIGH for PWM and LOW for VPW\nThe following code that will both turn on power to J1850 circuit AND set level for either PWM or VPW:\nvoid setup() {\n  pinMode(PS_J1850_9141, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(PWM_nVPW, OUTPUT);\n\n  digitalWrite(PS_J1850_9141, HIGH);  // LOW  = no power at +12V_SW/+5V_SW\n                                      // HIGH = power at +12V_SW/+5V_SW\n\n  digitalWrite(PWM_nVPW, HIGH);       // LOW  = ~7.9v (VPW)\n                                      // HIGH = ~5.9V (PWM)\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n}\n\n"},"m2/technical-references/communication.html":{"url":"m2/technical-references/communication.html","title":"Communication","keywords":"","body":"Communication\nXBee-compatible socket\nM2 has an XBee-compatible form factor socket on the top of the processor board.

You may also wish to reference the modem's datasheet.\nSetup\nThe modem plugs directly into the 20 pin wireless socket on top of your M2. Make sure that it is oriented correctly with the angled chamfers pointed toward the USB/SD side of your M2.  Please make sure your M2 is not being powered when plugging in the modem.\nBefore plugging the modem into your M2, make sure to install a SIM card. This modem uses a 4FF (Nano) size SIM card.\n\nPower\nAs you work with the Digi modem, please keep in mind that it requires more power that your computer can provide directly over a USB port. You have 2 options:\n\nPower your M2 via the OBD2 port (i.e. plugging into your car or some sort of adapter)\nUse a powered USB hub. This option is preferable for desktop development. We've had good luck with this inexpensive hub:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Port-2-5A-power-adapter/dp/B00DQFGH80\nBasic communication\nA good first step is to check that everything is working it to talk to the modem from your computer, through your M2. For this, you need to program your M2 with a simple sketch that will forward data between the 2 serial ports:\n\nUSBSerial, the USB connection between the M2 processor and your computer.\nSerial0, the Serial connection between the M2 processor and the XBee socket pins\n\nThis sketch will also make the GREEN LED blink as the associate pin of the modem toggles. The pin signals and locations for the modem can be found here.\nint AssociateState = 0;            // variable for reading the associate status\n\nvoid setup() {\n  Serial.begin(9600);              // Serial port for XBEE socket\n  SerialUSB.begin(9600);           // Native USB port\n  pinMode(XBEE_MULT2, INPUT);      // DIGI Associate PIN\n  pinMode(DS6, OUTPUT);            // Green LED\n  pinMode(XBEE_RST, OUTPUT);\n  digitalWrite(XBEE_RST, HIGH);    // Make sure RESET is HIGH\n  pinMode(DS2, OUTPUT);\n  digitalWrite(DS2, LOW);          // Turns on Red LED\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n\n  if (SerialUSB.available()) {     // read from port 1, send to port 0:\n    int inByte = SerialUSB.read();\n    Serial.write(inByte);\n  }\n\n  if (Serial.available()) {        // read from port 0, send to port 1:\n    int inByte = Serial.read();\n    SerialUSB.write(inByte);\n  }\n\n  AssociateState = digitalRead(XBEE_MULT2);\n\n  if (AssociateState == HIGH) {\n    digitalWrite(DS6, HIGH);       // turn LED on:\n  } else {\n    digitalWrite(DS6, LOW);        // turn LED off:\n  }\n}\n\nThe second part to a basic communication test is the software on your computer. Digi offers a nice UI called XCTU to communicate with their products. Download the latest verison.\nOnce downloaded and installed, launch XCTU and follow the instructions from Digi's documentation.\nFrom there, you can do all sorts of fun things, from sending an SMS to connecting to servers to posting data to a website.

The result being both faster reading and writing, and freeing up the SPI interface for other fun stuff. If for some reason, SPI is needed, we did include some 0 ohm jumpers on the PCB to allow for SPI connection. These are left open by default.\n\nFor in-depth explanation of how the HSMCI works, refer to the SAM3X datasheet, starting on page 909.\nUsing the SD card slot on your M2 is pretty straight-forward since the complexities are abstracted through a library which was automatically installed for you when you setup your Arduino IDE for the Macchina M2.
